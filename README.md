# Ezpy (Easy Python)

How to use:
- Write main program logic in the `main()` function of `main.py`
- The `main.py` file automatically imports all `.env` variables
    - Add more variables to the `.env` file as needed
    - By default, variables are accessible as assigned in `.env` file
- The main.py file automatically imports all `locfunc/` files
    - If a function file is added then update `__init__.py` to reflect
